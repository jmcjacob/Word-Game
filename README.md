<h1>Word Game</h1>
Jacob's Word Game is a collection of three word game that will use a text file of words. The application will also feature a screen that will allow the administrator of the game to add new words, or remove words to the game. Each game will have three difficulties, Easy, Medium and Hard. Each difficulty will affect the words used in the game, the number of tries they have and the time on the timer. The player can lose the game in two different ways either by running out of time on the timer or byrunning out of tries. If the player wins the game a score is then calculated using the number of tries left and the time left on the timer. The games in the application are:

<b>Guess The Word:</b> a hangman style game that has players guessing letters trying to guess the entire word.

<b>Conundrum:</b> a game where the players are presented with a word that has been shuffled and the player has to guess the original word.

<b>Fill in the Blanks:</b> a game where the player is presented with a word with letters removed. The player then has to fill in the letters to remake the original word.
